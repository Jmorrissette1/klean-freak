                        How dirty did you get today? Growing up in the Kitsap corner of the Pacific Northwest, 
                        I learned early on that if your rig is clean, you probably didn't have enough fun this weekend. 
                        Spending my younger years hauling gear down gravel roads, I often came home with more of the trail on my floorboards than under my boots. 
                        I spent a lot of time hosing down my rig at the house 'cause the local washes just weren’t built for the "PNW kind of dirty." 
                        Not only were the wheel wells missed they couldn't handle the thick, clay-heavy mud and leaf debris we specialize in out here. 
                        I realized our rural community needed a place that didn't just rinse off dust, but actually understood the grit of a life well-lived.

                       "feel-good kind of klean" whenever the mood strikes.
